## How I approached it

I find the second highest salary by taking the max of all salaries that are less than the highest salary, which I get with a subquery. My first idea was to sort all salaries and pick the second one, but that does not work because salaries are not unique. Using a subquery to find the highest salary first makes this work.

**How I got there:** I noticed that I need to find the highest salary first, so I can exclude it from the rest of the salaries. Then I can take the max of the remaining salaries, which will be the second highest. I used a subquery to find the highest salary.

1. Find the highest salary with a subquery.
2. Select all salaries that are less than the highest salary.
3. Take the max of these salaries, which will be the second highest.

**Pattern to remember:** When I need to find the second highest or second smallest of something, I can find the highest or smallest first, then find the highest or smallest of the rest.

**Watch out for:** If there is only one unique salary, this will return null, which is correct, but I need to make sure my query handles this case.

    select max(salary) from Employee
) ;
```

<details>
<summary><b>Problem statement</b></summary>

Table: `Employee`

```text
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```

Write a solution to find the second highest **distinct** salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, return `null (return None in Pandas)`.

The result format is in the following example.

### Example 1

```text
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

### Example 2

```text
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```
